n their work by providing a large
 number of excellent and feature packed high level functions that do
 visualization.  The library needs OpenGL to render the graphics and
 for Linux machines Mesa is necessary. The terms/copyright can be read
 in /usr/share/doc/vtk/README and README.html.  VTK-Linux-HOWTO has
 information about using vtk, getting documentataion or help and
 instructions on building VTK.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries needed to run C++ programs
 that use VTK.
 .
 To compile C++ code that uses VTK you have to install libvtk5-dev.
