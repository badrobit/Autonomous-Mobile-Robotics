Description: Not Erik's Windowing Toolkit - text mode windowing with slang
 Newt is a windowing toolkit for text mode built from the slang library.
 It allows color text mode applications to easily use stackable windows,
 push buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, lists, entry fields, labels,
 and displayable text. Scrollbars are supported, and forms may be nested
 to provide extra functionality. This package contains the shared library
 for programs that have been built with newt.

Size: 75340
Description: Tracks runtime library calls in dynamically linked programs
 ltrace is a debugging program which runs a specified command until it
 exits.  While the command is executing, ltrace intercepts and records
 the dynamic library calls which are called by
 the executed process and the signals received by that process.
 It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.
 .
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have the source handy.
 .
 You should install ltrace if you need a sysadmin tool for tracking the
 execution of processes.
